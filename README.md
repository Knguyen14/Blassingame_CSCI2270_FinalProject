Welcome to my project! 

Project Summary:
My program allows you to manipulate a hash table and a BST using movie titles and years. I used a lot of some of the assignments we've done for this class, and modified them to work with each other. The menus in the program are pretty self-explanatory, especially if you've done the assignments.

How to Run:
Download and set up the code in your VM. That's the hard part -- it's pretty simple once you get it running. Enter the number that corresponds with the menu item that you want to pick (for example, if you enter '1', you'll insert a movie into the hash table. It will prompt you for the title and year, which you should enter).

Dependencies:
None (I think?)

System Requirements:
None (Runs on VM?)

Open issues/bugs:
If you add a movie to the tree and then try to delete it, it seg faults. For example, enter '5', 'a', '1', '9', 'a', and you should get a seg fault.
